      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>BEAT eggs, water, salt and pepper in small bowl until blended.</li>
        <li>HEAT butter in 6 to 8-inch nonstick omelet pan or skillet over
            edium-high heat until hot. TILT pan to coat bottom. POUR IN egg mixture.
            Mixture should set immediately at edges.</li>
        <li>GENTLY PUSH cooked portions from edges toward the center with inverted
            turner so that uncooked eggs can reach the hot pan surface. CONTINUE cooking,
            tilting pan and gently moving cooked portions as needed.</li>
        <li>When top surface of eggs is thickened and no visible liquid egg remains,
            PLACE filling on one side of the omelet. FOLD omelet in half with turner.
            With a quick flip of the wrist, turn pan and INVERT or SLIDE omelet onto plate. SERVE immediately.</li>

      <h2>INSIDER INFO</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>This French omelette recipe is a classic and versatile favorite.
              Fill with cheese and ham or change it up by adding leftover
              cooked vegetables.</li>
          <li>Invent your own fillings. Some classic omelet fillings include
              shredded Cheddar or Gruyere cheese, sour cream, diced ham, crisp
              bacon, sautéed mushrooms, bell peppers or tomatoes, caramelized
              onions, fresh herbs or even leftovers from last night’s dinner.</li>
          <li>For a sweet omelet, omit pepper and add a dash of sugar to egg
              mixture. Fill with preserves, finely chopped toasted nuts or
              berries; dust with powdered sugar. For an elegant touch, spoon
              a tablespoon of warmed Cognac or Grand Marnier over and flambé.</li>
          <li id="li4">Prepare filling first. French omelettes cook so quickly, any
              fillings should be ready to go before starting the eggs.
              Plan on 1/3 to 1/2 cup filling per 2-egg omelet. Raw foods
              should be cooked. Refrigerated foods should be heated.
              Shredded cheese and room temperature foods, such as jams
              and jellies, are fine as is. Pieces should be small
              to prevent tearing the omelet when it’s folded.</li>
          <li>Made-to-order: French omelettes are best cooked one at
              a time and served immediately.</li>
          <li>For more servings, multiply the French omelette recipe
              as needed, preparing only as many eggs as you will use in a
              short time. Use 1/2 cup egg mixture per omelet.</li>
          <li>Omelet pans are shallow and have sloped sides – designed
              for ease of moving the omelet mixture during cooking and for
              sliding the finished omelet out. If you don’t have an omelet
              pan, it’s best to use a heavy skillet with sloping sides.</li>
          <li>For beginners: 1/3 to 1/2 cup filling for a 2-egg omelet can
              be difficult to manage at first. Try putting only half the
              filling inside the French omelette. Spoon the rest across the
              top of the omelet after it’s on the plate.</li>
