    <p>A crispy pie that you can adapt for your needs, add chicken or
      keep it veggie. A good fail-safe for your repertoire</p>
    <div class="Ingredience">
      <h2>ingredince</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>200g bag spinach leaves</li>
        <li>175g jar sundried tomato in oil</li>
        <li>100g feta cheese, crumbled</li>

      <h2>Cocking instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Put the spinach into a large pan. Pour over a couple tbsp water,
          then cook until just wilted. Tip into a sieve, leave to cool a
          little, then squeeze out any excess water and roughly chop.
          Roughly chop the tomatoes and put into a bowl along with the
          spinach, feta and eggs. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Carefully unroll the filo pastry. Cover with some damp sheets of
          kitchen paper to stop it drying out. Take a sheet of pastry and
          brush liberally with some of the sundried tomato oil. Drape oil-side
          down in a 22cm loosebottomed cake tin so that some of the pastry
          hangs over the side. Brush oil on another piece of pastry and
          place in the tin, just a little further round. Keep placing the
          pastry pieces in the tin until you have roughly three layers,
          then spoon over the filling. Pull the sides into the middle,
          scrunch up and make sure the filling is covered. Brush with a
          little more oil.</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Cook the pie for 30 mins
          until the pastry is crisp and golden brown. Remove from the
          cake tin, slice into wedges and serve with salad.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>MAKE IT VEGGIE</h4>
      <p>Chicken pies: Add 1 cooked, shredded chicken breast to the
        spinach mixture, then oil 3 sheets of filo per portion and lay
        them out on top of each other. spoon a few tbsp of the mixture
        onto one end of each pastry stack. fold over the edges and roll up
        to make cigar-shaped packages. Brush with oil and cook for 15 mins or
        until golden and crisp..</p>
